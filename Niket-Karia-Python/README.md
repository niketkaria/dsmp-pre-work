### Project Overview

 Hi,

This Project is about the Students Management System(Examination Scores of Students in a College/School).



### Learnings from the project

 I learned how to use all methods with Lists, Dictionaries.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this project i just referred to the notes what i call as handy help and also i had google some things which i couldnot recall.


### Challenges faced

 One Major Challenge I faced during this project is How to use Max syntax to get Max Value from a dictionary.Since Dictionaries are Key:Value Pairs and we have to write the syntax that actual scans the entrire dictionary and gives the result.


### Additional pointers

 I need help or guidance for the MAX syntax what i mentioned above.
